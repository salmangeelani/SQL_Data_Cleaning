This project contains a SQL file where I have performed data cleaning  and EDA of the layoff data set for the years 2020, 21, and 22 until the first quarter of 2023. I have uploaded the cleaned file in SQL format, and the original file is available in CSV format. Also, a brief exploratory data analysis is done with advanced CTEs so as to get an idea about the company, year and total laid offs and also did rank them as top 5 year by year.
